# pyQ-Simple-LSTM-Model
Using of quandl data &amp; LSTM Model within pyQ to generate sample predictions

**To run this script:**
```
1) Ensure pyQ and the necessary libraries within python are installed (such as workalendar and keras)
2) Have 64bit q 
3) q startup.q
4) The relevant logic can be searched within script.q to look at the various variables defined
5) Note that there are various python functions that can be called within the q process 
```

**Pending Work:**
```
1) Multivariate LSTM model
```
