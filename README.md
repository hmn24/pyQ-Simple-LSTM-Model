# pyQ-Simple-LSTM-Model
Using of quandl data &amp; LSTM Model within pyQ to generate sample predictions

**To run this script:**
```
1) Ensure pyQ and the necessary libraries within python are installed (such as workalendar and keras)
2) Have 64bit q 
3) q startup.q
4) If not using the archive version, would need to modify __init__.py within the anaconda pyq directory to use this file
This is to ensure it defines in q the correct namespaces for all python functions
5) Simon's Garland k4 unit test is used to test if python functions are working as intended
6) system "l script.q"
7) The relevant logic can be searched within script.q to look at the various variables defined
8) Note that there are various python functions that can be called within the q process 
```

**Pending Work:**
```
1) Multivariate LSTM model
```
